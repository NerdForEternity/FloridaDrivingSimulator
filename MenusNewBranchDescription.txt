I created functioning placeholder menus. I created a start menu, pause menu, and a game over menu. The start button on the start menu brings the player to the "level1" scene where the first level or wherever we want the player to spawn in will start. The pause menu pauses the game by setting the time scale to zero. Game can be paused and unpaused at will. The game over screen does not come up yet because there is no way to lose the game yet but the buttons should work.
